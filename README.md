# Python-API-Challenge
In this Challenge, I was tasked with making Python Scripts utilizing APIs.
In the folder names "WeatherPy", you will find two Python scripts that I have written.
The first one is called, "WeatherPy.ipynb". In this script I was tasked with Creating Plots to Showcase the Relationship Between Weather Variables and Latitude and then to Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship. My conclusions for each Linear Regression Relationship can be found inside the script along with saved Png. files, of all the Graphs I have created in this script.

In the second Script file named, "VacationPy.ipynb", I was tasked with utilizing my understanding of using Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to employ my Python skills to create map visualisations. In doing so, I have created two Map Visualizations that can be viewed in my Script. 

Overall, I have found this assignment to be a lot more challenging then I expected due to encountering multiple errors while coding. The use of APIs was still new to me and getting myself to understand it was a bit challenging. In the end, I was able to understand it abit more and thus, fix my coding issues to finally, finishing this assignment.
